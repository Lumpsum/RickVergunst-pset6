###My Music Database

This app lets you search your favourite artist, album or track, where you will be able to add those to your favourites list.
Next to that you can see other users that liked those artists and are able to look at their favourites and even add them to create a shortcut to that user.
This app is based on the last.fm api and uses a firebase to keep track of the accounts.
The log in details are an email and a password which are anonymous to the world.
