###Review of Pset6

1 - Names are very consistent and clear overall  
2 - No headers are present, should be added for the final deadline  
3 - Comments are there but way too few  
4 - Layout is quite clear and consistent in the app  
5 - Formatting is usually clear, some parts can be better  
6 - Flow is quite simple as most method are kept in one class  
7 - A lot of generic data structure which makes the code compact  
8 - Most of the expressions are simple, could be better  
9 - A few routines could be more compact, but overall the routines are simple and easy to follow  
10 - Modules are very well seperated and used troughout the app
